This is a daily journal of Carlos María de Bustamante, a prominent newspaper editor and politician in the newly independent Mexican nation. 
                Bustamante lived from 1774 to 1848. His diary covers 1823-1848. The period 1823-48 is critical in the political development of the fledging Mexican independent state. Mexico declared independence in 1821 and soon this was recognized by Spanish authorities. However, the beginnings were rocky. The first empire lasted two years, in 1824 a new constitution was passed with a republican form of government. Disputes between different factions and regions led eventually to a centralist regime in 1833 that attempted to concentrate more power in Mexico City with considerable resistance in other regions, and increasing fight between liberal and conservative facitons. No president lasted longer than a couple of years and a picturesque strongman (caudillo) dominated the political scene in most years (Santa Anna). In 1845 the US-Mexico war started, finalizing with the loss of 50% of Mexico’s territory.
