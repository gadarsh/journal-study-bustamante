            <p>## Introduction/Background
### Intro
Carlos María de Bustamante was a prominent newspaper editor and politician in the newly independent Mexican nation. Bustamante lived from 1774 to 1848, his daily journal covers the period from 1823-1848. This period is critical in the political development of the fledging Mexican independent state. Mexico declared independence in 1821 and soon this was recognized by Spanish authorities. However, the beginnings were rocky. The first empire lasted two years, in 1824 a new constitution was passed with a republican form of government. Disputes between different factions and regions eventually led to a centralist regime in 1833 that attempted to concentrate more power in Mexico City with considerable resistance in other regions, and increasing fight between liberal and conservative factions. No president lasted longer than a couple of years and a picturesque strongman (caudillo) dominated the political scene in most years (Santa Anna). In 1845 the US-Mexico war started, finalizing with the loss of 50% of Mexico’s territory.

### Structure of the daily journal
Bustamante followed a pattern in his journal. He had a header for the month, then he started each day with the date, followed by a record of his climate impressions, then he wrote the daily entry of events in the city, country and the world. At the end of the day or of the month he clipped newspaper articles. The Diario was transcribed and published in the late 19th century. The journal was available in PDF formal and was well structured with color coding and common formatting.

### Issues we faced
The first months of the journal had no climate observations. The first climate observation started on “Jueves 9 de enero de 1823” (9 Jan 1823), page 71. - The quality of the transcription is very good, but we are bound to find some minor issues. For instance: “Jueves 16 de enero de 1 823” —> notice the space in between the 1 and the 8. In addition, some days lacked a climate observation or were be skipped entirely (e.g. 9 Jan 1831). Many dates were repeated in the newspaper/pamphlet clippings.

            <h3>Issues we faced</h3>
            <p>-	The first months of the diary do not have climate observations. The first climate observation starts on “Jueves 9 de enero de 1823” (9 Jan 1823), page 71. 
                -	The quality of the transcription is very good, but we are bound to find some minor issues. For instance: “Jueves 16 de enero de 1 823” —> notice the space in between the 1 and the 8.
                -	Some days may lack a climate observation or may be skipped entirely (e.g. 9 Jan 1831).
                Careful: many dates are repeated in the newspaper/pamphlet clippings. This is why I think the structure of the text is important. 
                Finally, there’s no need to use the diacriticals in building tokens. I suggest to keep them in the first outcome file that I mention below.
